In this folder we group all the Python codes discussed in the paper "Artificial Neural Network small-sample-bias-corrections of the AR(1) parameter close to unit root" by Haozhe Jiang, Ostap Okhrin and Michael Rockinger.

"Dataloader.py" is referred to the DGP we used.
"ANN_AR(1).py" is referred to our designed artificial neural network and its training process.
"Indirect_Inference.py", "Jackknife.py", "PolynomialRegression.py", and "RoyFuller.py" are the benchmark bias-reduction methods for comparison.
